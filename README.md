# simplerpg
simplerpg is a simple 2D open world game made in Python as a learning experience with pyglet and 2D games.

## Disclaimer
I'd like to make it clear that this project isn't meant to be a polished, released game that you'd pay for. This is my learning project that I'm using to learn Python, pyglet and the core aspects of game development, so a lot of the code will come off very inefficient or not well done.

While I appreciate and greatly encourage PRs and improvements, please don't send over simple fixes like naming patterns. These are mistakes I'll learn to fix myself.

## Install
Installing and running simplerpg is real easy. Clone (or download) the source code and extract it to a suitable location.

You'll need to install pyglet to get simplerpg to load.
```
pip install pyglet
```

Finally, run main.py to start the game.
```
py main.py
```
